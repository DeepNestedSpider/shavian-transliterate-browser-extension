# ToDo

- [x] Tranliterate text to shavian
- [ ] On/off switch on popup menu
- [ ] Only transliterate when page's language is english
- [ ] Create my own transliteration implementation

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.13. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
